# Server Side

üë®‚Äçüíº Now that we send that reference and any arguments to the backend when we
submit the form. We need an endpoint that will handle that POST request.

The POST request we're making includes the id of the action in the `rsc-action`
header:

```
file:///Users/kentcdodds/code/epicweb-dev/react-server-components/playground/ui/actions.js#updateShipName
```

We can use that to find the module and module function to call in our server
handler.

We'll be using a few server-side modules for parsing the form submission data.
As this is not a Node.js/hono.js course, some of this will be given to you. You
will be responsible for parsing out the action file to `import` and calling it
with the correct arguments.

When you're finished with this one you should finally be able to submit the
form and it should work!
