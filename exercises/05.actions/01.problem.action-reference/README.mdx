# Action Reference

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-server-components/action-reference" />

üë®‚Äçüíº Our users want to be able to change the name of the space ships. So Kellie
has brought in a new client component for editing the name. All you need to do
is click on the name in the details view and you'll be able to edit it.

Thanks to the work we did setting up the server for React Server Components,
our server is already set up to handle server actions. By adding a
`'use server'` to the top of the module, our Node.js loader we set up earlier
will handle converting our server actions into references which we'll send to
the client.

In this step, we're going to wire the server action up to the client and you can
take a look at the RSC output to find the reference in there.

üê® First, let's update the <InlineFile file="ui/actions.js" /> file to respond
properly. Then you can go to <InlineFile file="ui/ship-details.js" /> to import
that action and send it along to the client component.

üê® Finally in <InlineFile file="ui/edit-text.js" /> you can accept the action
and wire things up with the `useActionState()` hook from `'react'`.

Once you've done this, then you should be able to the rsc endpoint for a ship
(like <LinkToApp to="/rsc/1ff1991efe029" />) and you should be able to find the
action reference in the output (search for "actions.js").

	won't have anything working quite yet. Continue onto the next step.

<callout-warning>
	`react-server-dom-esm` does not allow you to specify a `method` or `encType`
	on a `form` element when you specify an `action` that's a reference to a
	server action. Instead, it will set those values at request time for you. I
	personally don't agree with this decision (I would prefer to stick with the
	platform defaults), but the React team feels like it's worth straying from the
	platform defaults in this case.
