# Revalidation

👨‍💼 You might notice that once we make a change to the ship name, the list on the
left doesn't update immediately. We are actually sending the updated UI so
what's the problem?

The problem is we're ignoring the RSC payload. We're only doing something with
the `returnValue`. Instead, we need to use the `root` as well to update our
component to use that value.

But here's the tricky thing. The `callServer` function is outside our component
so how can we call `setContentKey` within our `startTransition`?

We use fancy JavaScript tricks of course! Here's an example of what I mean:

```js
function increment() {
	throw new Error('This was called before Counter rendered')
}

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

	useEffect(() => {
		increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	}, [])

	return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

With this setup, you can call `increment` from anywhere in your code and it will
update the `Counter` component. This is because we're using a closure to keep
the `setCount` function around.

This totally breaks reusability of the component, but in our case we only have
a single `Root` component anyway, so it's perfectly safe.

Another challenge we're going to have in this bit is we need to only update the
cached value after the response has finished streaming, otherwise we'll just
render the pending UI right away which would be annoying.

You might think about doing something like this:

```js
const actionResponse = await createFromFetch(fetchPromise)
contentCache.set(contentKey, actionResponse)
updateContentKey(contentKey)
return actionResponse.returnValue
```

Unfortunately, this won't work because the promise resolves as soon as the
stream **starts** not when it ends. So we need something a little more fancy:

```js
function onStreamFinished(fetchPromise, onFinished) {
	// create a promise chain that resolves when the stream is completely consumed
	return (
		fetchPromise
			// clone the response so createFromFetch can use it (otherwise we lock the reader)
			// and wait for the text to be consumed so we know the stream is finished
			.then(response => response.clone().text())
			.then(onFinished)
	)
}
```

Basically, we're cloning the response so we can read the text from it without
locking the reader (otherwise we'd prevent `createFromFetch` from using it).
This way we can know when the stream is finished and update:

```js
const fetchPromise = fetch(/*...*/)
onStreamFinished(fetchPromise, () => {
	updateContentKey(contentKey)
})
const actionResponsePromise = createFromFetch(fetchPromise)
// ... etc
```

It's important that you call `onStreamFinished` before calling `createFromFetch`
so we can make a copy of the response before `createFromFetch` starts consuming
it.

So yeah, doing a couple interesting things in this one, but it should result in
a great user experience! Enjoy!
