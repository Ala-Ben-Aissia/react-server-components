# Revalidation

👨‍💼 You might notice that once we make a change to the ship name, the list on the
left doesn't update immediately. We are actually sending the updated UI so
what's the problem?

The problem is we're ignoring the RSC payload. We're only doing something with
the `returnValue`. Instead, we need to use the `root` as well to update our
component to use that value.

But here's the tricky thing. The `callServer` function is outside our component
so how can we call `setContentKey`?

FIXME: This is not done!
