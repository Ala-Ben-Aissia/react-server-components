<callout-warning>
	`react-server-dom-esm` does not allow you to specify a `method` or `encType`
	on a `form` element when you specify an `action` that's a reference to a
	server action. Instead, it will set those values at request time for you. I
	personally don't agree with this decision (I would prefer to stick with the
	platform defaults), but the React team feels like it's worth straying from the
	platform defaults in this case.
