# Client Side

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-server-components/client-side" />

When we fetch an RSC payload, it's going to have our action in there.
`react-server-dom-esm/client` needs to be told what to do when the action is
called.

This is where the `callServer` function comes in. You pass that as an option
to `createFromFetch` and whenever an action is called, it will call your
function. It's your job to send the action to the server and return the
return value.

So please implement the `callServer` function
in <InlineFile file="ui/index.js" /> and make sure it sends the action to the
server.

	At this stage, our server doesn't handle the POST request yet, but you can
	check the Network devtools to see that the request is being sent properly.
