# History Revalidation

👨‍💼 Stellar! You should be proud of yourself for making such a great user
experience when the user hits forward and back.

You might be bothered by the momentary flash of the old state when you hit back
while that state is getting revalidated. This is a trade-off of being able to
navigate the user immediately.
