# History Revalidation

👨‍💼 You might notice that now if you make a change to one of the ships, then hit
the back button the change will be lost. This is because the history is not
being revalidated when the back button is clicked.

Interestingly, this is the way the web platform works by default. When you
navigate back to a page, the browser will use a cached version of that page and
display it.

But we can do better. Let's revalidate on `popstate` events as well!

This will be similar to the revalidation we did earlier. Good luck!
