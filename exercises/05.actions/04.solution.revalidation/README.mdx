# Revalidation

👨‍💼 Great job! Now we're getting automatic revalidation of our UI as part of our
actions. This is a great way to ensure that our UI is always up-to-date with the
latest data.

What's really cool about this is it applies to all of our actions. Additionally
this simulates the behavior of the web platform. Whenever you submit a form, the
browser will trigger a full page refresh by default, effectively revalidating
your entire page. We're doing the same thing, just more efficiently.

Good job!
