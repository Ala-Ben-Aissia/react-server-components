# Action Reference

👨‍💼 Great! So this is what a reference looks like in the client:

```
d:{"id":"file:///Users/kentcdodds/code/epicweb-dev/react-server-components/playground/src/actions.js#updateShipName","bound":null}
```

So it's the path to the module + `#` + the name of the function. This is how we
can find it on the server when the user submits the form. Let's get that passed
along to the server next!
