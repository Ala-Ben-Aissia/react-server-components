# Node.js Loader

👨‍💼 Alright, we're going to get our server ready to start handling `'use client'`
modules because we want to add some client-side interactivity to our app.

We're planning on adding the ability to change the ship names by clicking on
them. The idea is, the ship name is a button and when you click on it, it'll
change to a form with an input which you can then submit and that will update
the name. We'll get to the actual implementation for updating later, but for now
we just need to get our client-side code for the edit state working.

🧝‍♂️ I've already updated the `importmap`
script in <InlineFile file="public/index.html" /> to handle bringing in
`react-error-boundary`. I've also
created <InlineFile file="server/rsc-loader.js" /> which you'll need to register
with Node.js as a loader for turning `'use client'` module exports into
reference registrations.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie. So now, what you need to do is register the loader, update the
`dev` script in <InlineFile file="package.json" /> to import the loader
registration.

```sh nonumber nolang
node --import ./server/register-rsc-loader.js --conditions=react-server --watch server/app.js
```

Now update the <InlineFile file="ui/edit-text.js" /> to add `'use client'` to
the top of the module.

When you're finished, we'll not actually be loading modules yet, but we'll be
almost ready to do it! I recommend you add a couple console logs so you can
observe what the loader does to our `'use client'` module exports.

💰 I've put a couple good ones in place for you.
