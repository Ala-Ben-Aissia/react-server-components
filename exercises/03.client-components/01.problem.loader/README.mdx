# Node.js Loader

👨‍💼 Alright, we're going to get our server ready to start handling `'use client'`
modules because we want to add some client-side interactivity to our app.

One thing that requires client-side state is Error Boundary components. So
that's what we're going to start with.

🧝‍♂️ I've already updated the `importmap`
script in <InlineFile file="public/index.html" /> to handle bringing in
`react-error-boundary`. I've also
created <InlineFile file="server/rsc-loader.js" /> which you'll need to register
with Node.js as a loader for turning `'use client'` module exports into
reference registrations.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie. So now, what you need to do is register the loader, update the
`dev` script in <InlineFile file="package.json" /> to import the loader
registration.

```sh nonumber nolang
node --watch --import ./server/register-rsc-loader.js --conditions=react-server server/app.js
```

Now create and use the `error-boundary.js` `'use client'`
module.

When you're finished, we'll not actually be loading modules yet, but we'll be
almost ready to do it! I recommend you add a couple console logs so you can
observe what the loader does to our `'use client'` module exports.

💰 I've put a couple good ones in place for you.
