# Module Resolution

üë®‚Äçüíº We've successfully converted any of our `'use client'` modules into special
modules which register themselves as client references. Now we need to help
`react-server-dom-esm` resolve these properly when generating the RSC payload
and resolve that to the correct URL for loading the client module in the
browser.

On the server-side, we need to tell `renderToPipeableStream` how to convert the
full-path file URL of our client modules into relative URLs the browser can use.
This will also allow `renderToPipeableStream` to warn us if any client modules
are imported outside of the proper base directory.

On the client-side, we need to tell `createFromFetch` how to convert the
relative path into a full URL for fetching the client module.

<callout-warning>
	Because `react-server-dom-esm` is the one performing the dymamic import, all
	imports will be relative to that module. On the client, we're loading it from
	[esm.sh](https://esm.sh), so we'll want to make sure we give the full URL to
	our server including the origin.
</callout-warning>

<callout-success class="aside">
	You may be surprised to find that our error boundary which is already
	configured in <InlineFile file="src/index.js" />
	actually works before we complete any of these steps. This is because the `src/index.js`
	file is loaded in the client separate from our RSC server, so it's able to load
	the error boundary directly and renders on the client without needing to be resolved
	by the RSC server.
