# Server Context

Problem: Prop drilling everything

We're going to create the
[`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html) object
in <InlineFile file="server/async-storage.js" /> (click to create the file). In
there you'll create an `AsyncLocalStorage` object called `shipDataStorage` and
`export` it.
