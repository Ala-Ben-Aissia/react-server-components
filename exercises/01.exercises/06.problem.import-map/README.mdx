# Import Map

Problem: Map imports to the resources they should come from so we don't have to
pass the absolute URL to the resource.

ðŸ’° I'm going to be especially helpful in this one because there's some config
and node/express-specific stuff going on in here that you're not really here to
learn. It's enough for you to know that this is an important part of getting
the right resources to the right place. But spending time futzing around with
the specifics isn't helpful. Feel free to delete my code if you want to try and
do it yourself though.
