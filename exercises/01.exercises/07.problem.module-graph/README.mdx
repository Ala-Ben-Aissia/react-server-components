# Split Module Graph

Problem: Support client-side hydration without sending the entire server-side
module code to the client. This enables server-only code which can access the
database, filesystem, etc. without being sent to the client.

	NOTE: Now that we have the RSC module graph with `react-server-dom-esm`
	rendering our app, be sure to take a look at the output by opening the RSC
	server directly in the browser and check out the serialized JSX!
