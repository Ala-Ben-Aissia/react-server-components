Go to <LinkToApp to="/busted"/> and you'll notice we're not handling errors
well. React Error Boundaries require client-side code.

	Because Error Boundaries are typically what you want to display when an error
	occurs, Remix will simulate Error Boundary behavior on the server so you will
	server-render the error rather than render the Suspense fallback followed by
	the error boundary.
