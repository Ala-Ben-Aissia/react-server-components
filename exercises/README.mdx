# ðŸ¤¹ React Server Components

<callout-danger>
	One of the challenges you're going to have to face is understanding the
	difference between the requirements of React Server Components and Actions vs
	our own choices in this specific implementation of RSCs. RSCs are a very
	low-level primitive and there are lots of ways to accomplish the same thing.
	Different implementations will have different trade-offs. Try to focus on the
	overall concepts and not get too bogged down in the specifics of this
	implementation.

<summary>Here's a bullet-point text version of this flowchart:</summary>

- User goes to site

  - Browser requests document
    - Server responds with document
      - Browser renders loading spinner
  - Browser requests client code
    - Server responds with client code
      - Browser updates UI components
  - Browser requests data
    - Server generates data response
      - Browser sends JSON
        - Browser updates UI with JSON data

- User triggers state change (i.e., route change)

  - Browser renders pending UI
  - Browser requests new data
    - Server generates data response
      - Browser sends JSON
        - Browser updates UI with JSON data

- User triggers action (i.e., form submission)
  - Browser renders pending UI
  - Browser makes POST request
    - Server performs action with POST body
      - Browser sends JSON
        - Browser updates UI with JSON data

![A flowchart for React Server Components and actions as described below](/img/super-simple-rsc.png)

<details>
<summary>Here's a bullet-point text version of the flowchart:</summary>

- User goes to site

  - Browser requests document
    - Server responds with document
      - Browser renders Suspense fallback
  - Browser requests JSX payload
    - Server generates Serialized JSX with `react-server-dom-esm/server.renderToPipeableStream`
      - Server streams Serialized JSX
        - Browser renders streamed UI with `react-server-dom-esm/client.createFromFetch`
          - Browser requests client component code
            - Server responds with client component code
              - Browser hydrates client components

- User triggers state change (i.e., route change) NOTE: This only applies once
  data starts streaming. Until then, state transitions act like a typical SPA.

  - Browser renders pending UI with `startTransition`
  - Browser requests JSX payload
    - Server generates Serialized JSX with `react-server-dom-esm/server.renderToPipeableStream`
      - Server streams Serialized JSX
        - Browser updates streamed UI with `react-server-dom-esm/client.createFromFetch`

- User triggers action (i.e., form submission)
  - Browser renders pending UI with `useActionState`
  - Browser makes POST (via `callServer`)
    - Server determines action and call with parsed request body
      - Server streams Serialized JSX and action return value
        - Browser updates streamed UI with `react-server-dom-esm/client.createFromFetch`
