# History

👨‍💼 You may have noticed that hitting the back and forward buttons in the browser
does not work. This is because the browser is not aware of the state changes
that are happening in the application. To fix this, we need to add an event
handler to when the browser history changes via the user clicking those buttons.

The event that's fired when the history changes is called `popstate`. We can
listen for this event and update the application state accordingly.

```js
function handlePopState() {
	// do stuff
}
window.addEventListener('popstate', handlePopState)

// then to clean up
window.removeEventListener('popstate', handlePopState)
```

Please add this event listener in a `useEffect` in our router logic.
