# Pending UI

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-server-components/pending-ui" />

üë®‚Äçüíº Sometimes our users are on slow networks so we should give them good feedback
when they interact with our application.

To be able to do this effectively, we need a few things:

1. Our transitions should take place within a `useTransition` `startTransition`
2. The `location` to remain unchanged until the transition is complete
3. We need a `nextLocation` state so we can determine what part of the location
   is changing

We've already got our transition wrapped in a `startTransition`, but this is the
global one from `react`. We need to use one from `useTransition` instead so we
get access to the `isPending` state.

Then we'll change our `location` to be a `nextLocation` and then use
`useDeferredValue` to get the `location` so that it remains unchanged until the
transition is complete.

Then we can add the `isPending` and `nextLocation` to our router context and use
that to determine pending states for our UI.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You're going to want to use the `parseLocationState` utility I made for this
one. Here's how it works:

```js
import { parseLocationState } from './router.js'

const location = '/abc123?search=starship'
const state = parseLocationState(location)
// ^ { shipId: 'abc123', search: 'starship' }
```

You can use that to parse the current location and the next location. If the
part you care about is different then you know you can show a pending state.
