# Client Router

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-server-components/intro-to-client-router" />

As the user navigates around your application, you need to keep the UI
up-to-date with what they should be looking at. Traditionally this means lazy
loading code for the new routes and requesting relevant data.

This is no different for React Server Components. However, instead of fetching
code and data, we fetch the up-to-date RSC payload (which is kind of like code
and data combined) and update the UI with that updated payload.

There are a lot of things to consider with this. For one, we don't want a full
page reload whenever users click links within the app as this is a poor user
experience and makes it harder to manage things like scroll position and focus.

We also want to do better than the browser can with regard to pending UI (really
anything is better than just the favicon turning into a spinner). So the router
needs to expose a mechanism to determine the location you're transitioning to
so the existing UI can be updated with a loading state while the new UI is
generated.

You'll want to handle race conditions in case the user gets a little indecisive
and clicks around a lot.

Finally, you'll want to also handling forward/back buttons to update the UI
to what it should be.

All of this is rather involved and can be a bit tricky to get right. We're going
to implement a simple version of a router in this exercise.
