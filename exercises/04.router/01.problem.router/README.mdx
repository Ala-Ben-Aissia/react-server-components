# Client Router

üë®‚Äçüíº In our <InlineFile file="src/ship-search.js" /> file, we have our search form
and the list of results which have links. The form and the list of results
technically all works, but triggers full page refreshes which we'd love to
avoid. Now that we have client components, we've made this a client module with
`'use client'` so we can use things like event handlers to prevent the default
behavior and update the UI without a full page refresh.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I created <InlineFile file="src/router.js" /> which is just a couple
utilities and a context for managing the state in a router along with a
`useRouter()` hook for accessing the context. You'll use these utilities to
navigate the user to the next destination as the user searches and selects
ships.

üë®‚Äçüíº Great, thank you Kellie! So what we need you to do is update
our <InlineFile file="src/index.js" /> to render the `RouterContext`
with the right values (you'll be implementing the `navigate` function) and then
update the <InlineFile file="src/ship-search.js" /> module to use the
`useRouter()` hook to navigate the user to the ship details page when they click
on a ship link.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here's a tip on the `mergeLocationState` utility you're going to need:

```js
import { mergeLocationState } from './router.js'

const location = '/abc123?search=starship'

const updatedSearch = mergeLocationState(location, { search: 'rocket' })
// ^ '/abc123?search=rocket'

const updatedShipId = mergeLocationState(location, { shipId: 'zxy987' })
// ^ '/zxy987?search=starship'
```

Once you have the updated location, you can pass that to the `navigate` function
you're gonna write.

Another tip, you're going to be using the
[`window.history`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) API
to update the URL in the browser without triggering a full-page reload. You'll
want to use the `pushState` method when the user selects a ship and
`replaceState` when the user types in the search. Feel free to read the docs to
dive into the differences between those, but this means your `navigate` function
will need to accept an option to determine if it should push or replace the
state.

Good luck!
