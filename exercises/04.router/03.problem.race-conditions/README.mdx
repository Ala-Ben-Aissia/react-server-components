# Race Conditions

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-server-components/race-conditions" />

üë®‚Äçüíº Networks are unpredictable. Let's imagine the user clicks around a lot and
that triggers several network requests:

```
*click* ------ request --------> update ui
  *click* ------ request --------> update ui
    *click* ------ request --------> update ui
```

That works nicely. But sometimes the requests come back in a different order for
whatever reason (network latency, server load, etc):

```
*click* --------- request ----------> update ui
  *click* ---- request ------> update ui
    *click* ----- request -------> update ui
```

This would be a pretty bad user experience because the UI would be updating in
a different order than the user clicked.

What would be better is if we avoid updating the UI if there's a newer request
going out.

This is easier than you might think:

```jsx
const latestNav = useRef(null)

// when we start a navigation:
const thisNav = Symbol()
latestNav.current = thisNav

// when we're ready to update the UI:
if (latestNav.current === thisNav) {
	// update the UI
}
```

That way any navigation that comes back out of order will be ignored.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've added a bit of code in <InlineFile file="server/app.js" /> to allow you
to simulate a race condition. Do a search for "star" and you'll notice after two
seconds, the URL gets updated to "?search=st" because we have a delay for that
search term. When you're finished, this should not happen.

Go ahead and make that magic happen!
