# RSCs

👨‍💼 Phew, it took a bit of work to get our server environment ready to generate
RSC content, but now that it is, we're no longer sending **any** custom
JavaScript to the client other than what's in <InlineFile file="src/index.js" />
and it will remain that way regardless of how big our app gets until we start
wanting to have interactive bits of UI in our app.

That's cool.

But what's even cooler is what we get to do next...
