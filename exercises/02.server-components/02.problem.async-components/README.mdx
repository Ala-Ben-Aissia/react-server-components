# Async Components

👨‍💼 Now that we have RSCs running on our server, our server components can be
`async`! This means we no longer have to worry about loading all of our data
before we render our components and passing that data as props. Instead, we can
have the components load their own data with `async`/`await`.

So please delete the two `await`s we have in our server code and update our
components to load their own data.
