# RSCs

👨‍💼 Right now we have to load all the data of our app and pass the result as
props to our components. Additionally, we're sending a bunch of code to the
client to render a page that really doesn't need to be on the client. We want
you to solve both of these problems by using `react-server-dom-esm` which will
allow us to generated serialized JSX on the server and render it in the browser.
