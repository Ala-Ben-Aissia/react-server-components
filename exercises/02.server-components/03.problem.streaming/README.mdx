# Streaming

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-server-components/streaming" />

🧝‍♂️ I've added a long delay to the `searchShips` API to make the improvements
here more noticable. Check <InlineFile file="db/ship-api.js" line={14} /> to see
how.

👨‍💼 Right now we display our loading screen until all the components finish
rendering. But if we want to put some well placed `Suspense` boundaries around
different server components, we can have a more granular loading experience.

Please add some suspense boundaries around the search results and ship details
so we can have things load in as they become ready.

As you do, I want you to appreciate the out-of-order streaming we get here which
enables a lot of flexibility in how we load things in (allowing us to prioritize
the most important parts of the page first).

<callout-warning>
	Note: more spinners is not necessarily better. In fact, it would be better to
	just server-render all of this stuff from the start and make it really fast so
	you don't need loading states at all and you avoid cumulative layout shift.
	But we're sticking with client-side rendering for now to keep things simple.
